Recently, I released the `{shiny.tailwind}` package which brings [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes to Shiny. This post is the first blog in a series of blogs that introduces TailwindCSS and shows how it can be used to quickly and easily design beautiful and responsive shiny applications

## Spacing items

`gap-x-#` and `gap-y-#`

<FlexExampleGap />




## Dynamic Layout

<FlexExampleGrow />


For example, you could set a width on a sidebar and have the main content fill the rest of the window's size.

<LargeBlock flex workshop>
  <div
    className={`flex w-full max-w-prose flex-row overflow-hidden rounded-md border-2 border-mine-shaft-200 bg-mine-shaft-50 dark:border-mine-shaft-600 dark:bg-mine-shaft-800`}
  >
    <div className="h-[24rem] w-48 bg-mine-shaft-400 text-white px-4 py-4 text-md">Sidebar</div>
    <div className="h-[24rem] flex-grow bg-white text-mine-shaft-800 px-4 py-4 text-md">Content here</div>
  </div>

</LargeBlock>
