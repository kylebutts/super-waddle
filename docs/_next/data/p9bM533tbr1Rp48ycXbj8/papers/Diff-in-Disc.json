Identification using the 'continuity assumption' is problematic in these settings since *even in the absence of treatment* people can sort on either side of borders (e.g. for lower taxes or better schools) and many policies change at the same border (tax-laws, police-services, schools, etc.).\n\nThis paper extends the proposed 'difference-in-discontinuities' estimator ([Grembi et al. (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150076))  to the geographic RD setting. The intuition of the difference-in-discontinuities design is very similar to the difference-indifferences design. A pre-treatment RD identifies the time-invariant effects of other laws as well as the discontinuity in outcomes due to time-invariant sorting. A post-treatment RD identifies those previous two discontinuities plus the one caused by the treatment of interest. The difference between the two identifies the treatment effect.\n\n<Figure src=\"/images/diff_in_disc.png\" alt=\"Example identification in the geographic difference-in-discontinuities estimator\" />\n\nThe paper goes into the theoretical assumptions that are necessary for the diff-in-disc method to work, but here is the intuition:\n\n- The untreated potential outcome must be continuous at the cut-off. Note that this untreated potential outcome is conceptually the outcome without *any treatments* (including the ones implemented in the past). A time-invariant \"jump\" discontinuity will be differenced out. \n\n- The effects of all other treatments must be \"fully observed\" in the pre-period. If not, then you can't disentangle the effects of the treatment of interest from the other treatments.\n\n- There can be no sorting in the post-period from the treatment of interest. This is a standard assumption in RD that allows units near the cutoff to be similar in covariates.\n\nThe paper concludes with a discussion of how to estimate the diff-in-disc estimator in a single RD regression on first-differenced outcomes using the modern robust RD tools.
